# DSA Systemic Risks Reports Archive

The European [Digital Services Act article 34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj/eng#art_34) mandates very large online platforms and search engines (VLOPSEs) to publish systemic risk assessments “at least once every year”. [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org/) makes these reports available independently from platforms hosting, and tracks any changes applied to the reports after they are published. This effort ensures the long term preservation of these documents to support research and guarantee platform accountability.

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dsa-reports-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dsa-reports-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/dsa-reports-versions` repository.

## Credits

This collection was created as a collaboration between [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org/) and [CheckFirst](https://checkfirst.network) as part of the [Hack the DSA](https://regulation-tech.cnam.fr/hack-the-dsa/) hackathon hosted by the CNAM’s _Chaire sur la Modération des Contenus_ in October 2025.

## Scope

The scope of the terms you will find in this collection is defined in the [`metadata.yml`](./metadata.yml) file.

## Contribute

In order to contribute additional terms to this collection or correct existing ones, please read the [documentation](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/contributing-terms/).

## CLI usage

Interacting with this collection can also be done over the command line. Read the [CLI documentation](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/#cli) for more information.

## Suggested engine updates

In order to keep the Open Terms Archive engine up-to-date, updates will be automatically suggested by [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) in a pull request when a new version is available.

While engine updates follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) standard and automated collection tests should provide a safety net, it is ultimately the responsibility of the maintainers of the collection to check version compatibility and potentially adjust the declarations before applying these updates.
